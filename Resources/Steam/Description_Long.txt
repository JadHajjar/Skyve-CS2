Skyve is your all-in-one mod manager for Cities: Skylines II and PDX Mods. It's a community-made open source project that offers simple and extensive control of your mods, browsing, and compatibility information, all in a standalone application that you can use before opening the game.
‎ 
[h1][b]Features[/b][/h1]
Skyve comes packed with features designed to simplify modding, here's what you can expect:
‎
[h2]PDX Mods Integration[/h2]
Skyve integrates seamlessly with PDX Mods, letting you browse mods directly within the tool. You’ll be able to:
[list]
	[*]Subscribe or unsubscribe from mods
	[*]Download new mods or update existing ones
	[*]Organize your playsets and enable/disable mods as needed
[/list]


On top of that, Skyve provides convenient bulk actions to make managing mods easier:
[list]
	[*]Subscribe, unsubscribe, enable, or disable multiple mods at once
	[*]Add or remove mods across all your playsets in one step
	[*]Merge or exclude another playset’s mods from your current playset
[/list]


[h2]Compatibility Information[/h2]
Skyve includes an [b]online compatibility catalogue[/b], maintained and updated by community members, giving you real-time information about the mods you’re using.
‎ 
Some of the ways it helps include:
[list]
	[*]Notifying you if a mod isn’t compatible with the latest game patch
	[*]Flagging mods that are broken or deprecated
	[*]Warning you if two or more of your mods conflict or overlap in functionality
	[*]Highlighting mods that could break your save if removed
	[*]Pointing out when a mod has been succeeded by a newer version
	[*]Letting you know if any requirements are missing for your active mods
[/list]
Skyve shows these warnings as you browse, so you’ll know in advance if a mod might cause problems before subscribing.
You’ll also have access to a [b]dedicated compatibility report page[/b], which lists all issues with your mods and even offers one-click fixes to resolve them quickly.
‎
[h2]Quality of Life[/h2]
The original and main goal is to make modding easy. And that includes quality of life features like:
[list]
	[*]Keeps your mods up to date automatically while you're not playing, so you can instantly hop into the game after being away for a few days.
	[*]Automatic backups of your cities, mods, settings, etc.
	[*]Move your mods content to different folders or drives without breaking your setup.
	[*]Advanced filtering, tagging, and actions while browsing your mods.
	[*]View connections between mod dependencies in a mod's references tab.
