  <LongDescription>
Skyve is your all-in-one mod manager for Cities: Skylines II and PDX Mods.
It's a standalone application that you can use without opening the game, and it allows you to manage playsets, download or update your mods, browse PDX Mods, and much more.

# Installation
After adding Skyve to your playset, you will see a new button in the main menu called "Install Skyve".
This will start the one-click installation process and open the Skyve app at the end.

Once you've installed Skyve, you'll be able to find it in your apps list on Windows.

\* *Note that this is a standard application setup, which will prompt you for user account control permission. And it requires you to uninstall it from your apps list to completely remove it from your computer.*

# Features
## PDX Mods Integration
Skyve comes with the same PDX Mods capabilities as the game. Which means you'll be able to browse PDX Mods directly from Skyve, alongside:
* Subscribe and unsubscribe from mods.
* Download new mods, or update mods you're subscribed to.
* Manage playsets and enable/disable mods within them.

Skyve also comes with extensive bulk actions:
* Subscribe/unsubscribe/enable/disable multiple mods at a time.
* Add or remove mods from
